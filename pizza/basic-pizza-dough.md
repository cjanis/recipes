## Metadata

- Expected time commitment
  - 10 minutes prep
  - 20 minutes waiting
  - 10 minutes cooking
- Servings: 2 crusts, each about 12 inches across
- Tools
  - Oven
  - Baking stone (optional but very helpful)
  - Pizza peel (optional but helpful)
  - Food processor or mixer
  - Plastic wrap
  - Parchment paper
  - Rolling pin (optional but helpful)

## Ingredients

- 2.75 cups of bread flour
- 2.5 teaspoons (1 packet) of active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons of salt (sea salt is ideal)
- 0.25 cups extra-virgin olive oil 
- 1 cup warm water

## Optional modifications

- Swap 0.5 cups of whole wheat flour for 0.5 cups of the bread flour. This will make your crust slightly more dense and slightly less sweet, and will make it more of a brown color.
- Add seasonings when you add the flour. Here are some good seasoning options you might try, depending on which toppings you're going to use:
  - Oregano, thyme, rosemary, and red pepper flakes
  - Jamaican jerk mix
  - Chinese five spice mix
  - Orange or lemon zest
- Before you add your toppings, brush the edge of the crust with melted butter, and perhaps sprinkle some seasonings on top.

## Instructions

1. Add the flour, yeast, and salt into your food processor and allow it to mix well.
  - If you want to, you can add the optional seasonings during this step.
2. While the food processor is running, slowly pour in the olive oil and the warm water, in that order.
  - The dough should be soft and elastic, but should not stick to the sides of your food processor.
  - If necessary, add more flour in small amounts to make it less sticky, or more olive oil to make it more soft and elastic.
4. Take the dough out of the food processor and use your hands to stretch and fold it over itself several times. Make indentations with your fingers in between each fold.
  - Think of this as a quick, gentle kneading process.
5. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and set it aside somewhere room temperature. Let it rise for about 20 minutes.
  - You should see it visibly expand, but if not, don't worry! The dough will still be usable, it will just be a bit more dense.
  - At this point you can put the dough into a ziplock bag or other container and store it in the fridge overnight if you need to, or you can even keep it in the freezer for a few days. If you do, just remember to bring the dough back to room temperature before you go on to the next step!
6. Lay out two sheets of parchment paper and sprinkle some flour on them. Unwrap the dough and tear it into two roughly equal pieces. Form each piece into a ball and place it on a sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle some more flour on top, and use your rolling pin or hands to spread it out until it's about the thickness of a piece of cardboard.
  - Don't worry about making it a pretty shape, all that matters is that the shape you end up with will fit on your baking stone.
7. Add your toppings!
  - Try to be moderate with any wet toppings (sauce, fresh mozzarella, etc) or you may find that the dough cooks up soggy in the middle. It'll still be delicious, but the texture will suffer.
8. Use your pizza peel or a baking tray to put your pizza and parchment paper into the oven. Depending on your oven's temperature, you'll likely need to let it cook between 5-10 minutes.
  - You'll have to use your best judgement about when to pull the pizza out. You're looking for a combination of a visibly-cooked crust (golden, solid, dry but not burnt) and well-prepped ingredients (melted cheese, rendered juices, etc).
  - Using a baking stone is helpful because it means that the bottom of the pizza will be thoroughly cooked and adds direct heat to your pizza rather than just the ambient heat in the oven's air. You'll get a better crust texture with a baking stone.
  - The parchment paper may brown or char a bit on the edges, and that's ok. Using the parchment paper means your crust won't stick at all to the baking stone or oven, and if any ingredients bubble off the edge of the crust your oven won't get dirty.
9. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool on the parchment paper for 5 minutes or so before you dig in.
